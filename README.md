# spectra-cluster

# Introduction
spectra-cluster is an open-source (Apache 2 licensed) library for clustering MS/MS spectra produced by mass spectrometers. It is designed with the goal of making
 spectra clustering easy to use and experiment for the community. It offers the following features out-of-box:

  - A collection of both classic and new algorithms for measuring [spectra similarities](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/similarity).
  - A set of [engines](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/engine) for clustering spectra together.
  - A set of [normalizers](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/normalizer) for normalising spectral peaks.
  - A set of [filters](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/util/predicate) and [functions](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/util/function) for pre-processing spectra, such as removing noisy peaks.
  - A set of cleanly defined data models and interfaces that represents spectra, peptide spectrum matches, and clusters.
  - Read in spectra and write out clustering results

# Getting started

### Installtion
You will need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed in order to build and use the spectra-cluster library.

Add the following snippets in your Maven pom file:

```maven
<!-- spectra-cluster dependency -->

    <groupId>uk.ac.ebi.pride.spectracluster</groupId>
    <artifactId>spectra-cluster</artifactId>
    <version>${current.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

```maven
 <!-- EBI repo -->
 <repository>
     <id>nexus-ebi-repo</id>
