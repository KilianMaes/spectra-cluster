{"name":"spectra-cluster","tagline":"An open-source library for clustering MS spectra. ","body":"# Introduction\r\nspectra-cluster is an open-source (Apache 2 licensed) library for clustering MS/MS spectra produced by mass spectrometers. It is designed with the goal of making\r\n spectra clustering easy to use and experiment for the proteomics community. It offers the following features out-of-box:\r\n\r\n  - A collection of both classic and new algorithms for measuring [spectra similarities](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/similarity).\r\n  - A set of [engines](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/engine) for clustering spectra together.\r\n  - A set of [normalizers](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/normalizer) for normalising spectral peaks.\r\n  - A set of [filters](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/util/predicate) and [functions](https://github.com/spectra-cluster/spectra-cluster/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/ebi/pride/spectracluster/util/function) for pre-processing spectra, such as removing noisy peaks.\r\n  - A set of cleanly defined data models and interfaces that represents spectra, peptide spectrum matches, and clusters.\r\n  - Read in spectra and write out clustering results\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nYou will need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed in order to build and use the spectra-cluster library.\r\n\r\nAdd the following snippets in your Maven pom file:\r\n\r\n```maven\r\n<!-- spectra-cluster dependency -->\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>uk.ac.ebi.pride.spectracluster</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>spectra-cluster</artifactId>\r\n    <version>${current.version}</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```maven\r\n <!-- EBI repo -->\r\n <repository>\r\n     <id>nexus-ebi-repo</id>\r\n     <url>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/maven/nexus/content/repositories/ebi-repo</url>\r\n </repository>\r\n\r\n <!-- EBI SNAPSHOT repo -->\r\n <snapshotRepository>\r\n    <id>nexus-ebi-repo-snapshots</id>\r\n    <url>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/maven/nexus/content/repositories/ebi-repo-snapshots</url>\r\n </snapshotRepository>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Running the library\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n# Getting help\r\nIf you have questions or need additional help, please contact the PRIDE help desk at the EBI.\r\n\r\nemail: pride-support@ebi.ac.uk\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\nPlease give us your feedback, including error reports, suggestions on improvements, new feature requests.
